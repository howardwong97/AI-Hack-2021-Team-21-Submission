If you didn't want cryptocurrency to become ubiquitous, you wouldn't want a coin with massive brand recognition to start being used as a universal digital currency. The coin with the potential to do that had been Bitcoin for many years.

So you would aggressively oppose Bitcoin instituting its long-planned hard fork, that would allow it to be used as electronic cash by the whole world.

If you had succeeded in sabotaging Bitcoin's scaling plan, you would next look to stop any social attempts to transplant the movement around Bitcoin to a fork that attempts to fulfil its original vision of allowing larger blocks AND has 'Bitcoin' in its name.

You could try to disrupt the market adoption of any such coin by creating a distraction coin, called Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision, and use it to dilute support for the potential successor to Bitcoin, so that it fails to get a critical mass of support.

Bitcoin Cash is the legitimate contender to Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision to me looks like the disinfo campaign to draw attention away from it and delegitimize Bitcoin forks as a class.",CryptoCurrency

## Attack methods

The methods of attack here are many. Essentially, **any trust placed on altcoin ledger apps can be exploited**. Consider the following:

* You are invited to try out a new service with testnet coins, that actually sweeps real Bitcoin out of your wallet.
* You swap low value coins on an untrusted exchange. The exchange can read your Bitcoin balances and given a good enough opportunity will take the exit. You wouldn't have applied the same level care with altcoins.
* You could be targeted with a patched version of Ledger Live that sends Bitcoin instead of altcoins. Then prompted to do a P2P trade with altcoins.

## Users

* Avoid using altcoin apps until fixes are available

## Disclosure Timeline

* 18 Jan 2019 - Privacy related aspect of the vulnerability (reading addresses) disclosed to Ledger via report and PoC.
   * Ledger: Firmware was updated but apps still need to be updated.
   * Prompted for public disclosure: Bug will be disclosed once apps are updated.
* 30 Apr 2019 - Disclosed issue unfixed - Ledger contacted for update. No response.
* 1 May 2020 - Discovered root cause expands to signing functions and can be exploited to steal funds
* 2 May 2020 - New report detailing bypassing the isolation for signing disclosed to Ledger with new report and PoC
* 4 May 2020 - Ledger investigating.
* 10 May 2020 - No response. Follow up.
* 12 May 2020 - Issue acknowledged - mistakenly at first as only privacy related - set out disclosure timeline
* ... - Exchanges with ledger clarifying severity and awareness
* 17 June 2020 - Request for update - No response
* 28 July 2020 - Request for update sent to Ledger Donjon - No response
* 03 Aug 2020 - Vulnerability not fixed or disclosed by Ledger. Public disclosure",CryptoMarkets

It seems like your premise is flawed by the straightforward “rules” of crypto security that people should always follow. Although those rules aren’t as simple, straightforward and agreed upon by everyone. But it seems self evident that connecting your Ledger directly to a desktop wallet is a bad idea.
Many companies have fucked up and exposed personal info, that doesn’t mean it’s easy or even necessary to stop using a product.  Be vigilant, change your passwords regularly and and use any 2FA available. All your basic personal info is already “out there” as far as I’m concerned. To think otherwise a bit delusional.

2020-08-06 06:54:37+00:00,"I thought people got better at understanding Bitcoins ecosystem in the last couple of years but there are a lot of new guys around so here we go again:

First of all China is a country. They dont control any hashrate. Secondly it makes little to no sense to build up your whole theory on the premise of lumping together mining pools because of their geolocation and pretend that since they are all situated in the same country they somehow are a single entity. Its a little far fetched but by that logic I can twist the narrative so Bitcoin is always centralized. Look at all the asians or look at europe working together with north americans to destroy bitcoin. Its nonsense.

Thirdly, even if it was the case that this was somehow one entity with the same goals, same principles and they all want to destroy their source of income and arent competing with each other. The statement still wouldnt be correct. While it is true that four Chinese mining pools (Poolin, F2Pool, BTC.com and Antpool) actually control the absolute majority of the BTC hashrate, these pools consist of thousands of individual Bitcoin miners who could change their respective pool in a blink of an eye should they threaten the network. These pools consist of real people with a vested interest in Bitcoin being successful, I dont think its realistic to pretend all these people would watch chinese miners burn down Bitcoin. I would bet a majority of them would switch pools if it comes to a point were they are trying to censor the blockchain.

Also: Its not a deep state conspiracy of the chinese government that makes these pools successful, Xi Jin Ping is not sitting in Beijing collecting hashrate so he can at some point censor Bitcoin. These pools are simply offering the best service for the lowest price. 

And yes, at the same time I'm not denying that there is the chance of intervention and the government taking over all the mining factories in Szichuan but the risk is laughably low.

Just in case people want to paint me as a maximalist: The majority of my cryptocurrency-investment isnt situated in Bitcoin. But the notion that somehow most of these ""alternative"" projects dont more or less have control over their ledger and arent inherently centralized is laughable. Its just a fact that we have to live with if we want to invest into most of them. It doesnt go away by denying it. And it also doesnt go away by attacking Bitcoin.",CryptoCurrency

Someone else already recommended them in the comments, but BlockFi would be the first option I would suggest as they're fully regulated in the US and provide the highest interest rates for BTC at 6% with no utility token requirements like similar platforms. No lockup or early withdrawal penalties and you get 2 free withdrawals a month (1 crypto/1 stablecoin). I like that they keep everything simple and straightforward. At the end of the day I do trust them which is the most important aspect of considering these Cefi options. I know their not gonna run away with my coins so I can comfortably recommend their services to family and friends. They also have a promo where you can receive $20 BTC if you deposit $500 or more with a qualified link like in the article below.

Let's assume increasing block size is a good idea and that transactions per second scale linearly.

A quick google search gives that BCH can do up to 116 txps with a block size of 8MB. Let's say BCH will become as successful as VISA. Google says VISA averages 1700 txps. So 1700/116 = 14,7 so roughly 15 times more than BCH can handle. Now the big brained BCH supporter just scale their block size by 15. 15x8MB = 120MB.
BCH now has a block size of 120MB. Which means 120x6x24x365 = 6.307.200 MB or roughly 6,3 terabytes of data will be added to the blockchain every year or in other words more than 24 times the amount of the current BTC blockchain that has been running for more than 10 years. A 6TB harddrive costs 150€ on amazon right now, no biggie right?

BUT 1700 is the average txps of the VISA network. What about peak txps on holidays? BCH will still be congested. Peak VISA transactions are more than 4000 per second. What do you do? Permanently triple the blocksize just for peak hours? Or accept that fees will be very high?

And what if BCH becomes more successful? There's still master card, american express, PayPal, Swift, venmo, cash app and MORE. 

Increasing blocksize solves NOTHING. So why bother increasing it to 8MB if other scaling methods need to be developed anyways.",CryptoCurrency

If any of you are on your ""crypto twitter of choice"" you know what an echo chamber it can be for any coin.

I'm not going to go into the Tron sub and spout about Bitcoin, so dont expect a warm welcome if you go into r/Bitcoin to tell us about the new thing that's ""this much better"". But I do invite you to at least check it out and see if anything's different since you last used BTC in 2017, made bank, but havn't used it since because fees were fifty bucks.

Speaking of fees, we hear that argument from everybody all day everyday. XYZ coin having low fees doesn't mean anything if the volume is low. Also, even in BTC I have barely paid any fees since 2018 when I spooled up a bitcoin Lightning node.

 [Fees](https://imgur.com/HMW0P9m) Heres a screenshot of my mobile wallet. Fees are insignificant. The catch? It's insanely complicated for the average Joe to set up unless you make tradeoffs, and there's virtually no adoption. Both of those issues are improving with time, just like all tech.

Since most of the rich and banks were leaving them alone now look around the world what’s happening again same shit different day.

Now if you can mine or buy bitcoin and store it because at one point or another the money they kept for themselves will be worthless why you think it will be so simple supplies and demand. Money carry’s with it a physical risk since it can carry the virus with it.

Now credit cards digital payments and anything without having contact with people will lead for a much safer and better future since most governments seems to want the virus to be here for a long time.

2020-08-08 16:53:44+00:00,"I think that's a fair characterization. Part of it is human nature/greed, and part of it is the specific history of crypto.

Bitcoin was the first crypto, and it started as an idea to bring 'peer to peer electronic cash' to the people. As BTC gained popularity, others began to build new projects based on its code. At first, no one really thought any of this was going to grow to be worth billions and trillions of dollars so the attitude was more like 'yay, magic internet money!' But as time went by, Bitcoin began to evolve (some would say it was pushed) from its original vision, and this created rifts in its community. Meanwhile, the 'copies' began to grow more complex and innovative, address fundamentally different problems vs. what Bitcoin was addressing, and therefore seek more of the spotlight for themselves. So that's a recipe for many different voices saying 'we are awesome, and the other guys suck'.

But a few additional factors really turn it up a notch:

* The core ideological values that underlie crypto (independence, privacy, trustlessness, 'fuck the man') lend themselves to enthusiastic, unfiltered expression in online communities, which very quickly degenerates into tribalism. Crypto started out as the pet project of a particular sort of 'libertarian nerd' demographic, which has historically been marginalized. Precisely because of that, many of the true believers are deeply invested in the expression of values they hold dear--this is their moment--and resent any attempt to modify or mainstream-ify the vision.
* In practice, the existence of tribally-inclined online communities provides an excellent opportunity for various kinds of manipulation (brigading, coordinated FUD attacks, biased crypto 'media' articles written by shills, etc.) by powerful interests. Crypto itself has always been more about ideas and ideals, and prices have mostly been speculative (plus the markets are still small overall), so manipulating sentiment has a disproportionate effect (which of course is the point, if you're a whale).
* Now, after the collapse of the first *public* crypto bubble and subsequent recovery, we're seeing a fresh influx of new blood, many of whom are younger and unaware of both crypto history and what has, until recently, been normal in financial markets in general. This makes them impressionable--relatively easy 'converts' to the sort of evangelism you describe. And the evangelism of a new convert, free from the burdens of context or conscience, is all the stronger.

To your point about staking rewards, I suspect it's less about staking rewards *per se* and more about staking rewards being an obvious, headlining sort of feature that a project can use to sway naive, impressionable investors: *Our project is better than the others because it gives you 57% interest*. No reasonable person should believe any of that, and yet history, both in crypto and for many years before that in the real world, shows that the mixture of hope, greed, and ignorance is a powerful drug.",CryptoCurrency

2020-08-09 04:51:01+00:00,">However when I look at bitcoin as a currency, it just doesn’t make any sense. For example you walk into a bar for a drink. The bitcoin transaction would most likely take an hour to get through and the fees would be at a ridiculous amount. Instead of paying $10 for a drink, it will probably be $14.95.

The biggest problem that cryptocurrencies are facing is the volatility, and it can go either way. Why would you as a consumer spend cryptocurrencies when in the future your purchasing power could increase? To name the biggest example of this, 10 years ago someone purchased 2 pizzas for 10k Bitcoin, how much are 10k Bitcoin worth today (a lot). It makes more financial sense to spend your inflating fiat.

On the flip side, why would a business accept it if it could go down in value? When it comes time for them to pay staff wages, rent, suppliers, and other business cost, the cryptocurrency they accepted a week ago may have dropped 20%. They will also need to calculate capital gains for each time they accepted and disposed of any cryptocurrencies, and set aside money to pay the tax. This last point is subject to which country the business is operating in, in mine this is the case as cryptocurrencies are viewed by the government as assets. *Any* disposal is subject to capital gains tax, even if you are gifting it to another person.

2020-08-09 05:04:54+00:00,"I feel like your post may be a low-key Nano shill, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.

Bitcoin started with a vision of being 'peer to peer electronic cash'. Over time, it became clear, at least to persons of influence within the Bitcoin world, that the currency use-case was, for reasons similar to the ones you outline, fraught with challenges. Consequently, Bitcoin itself has shifted to more of a 'store of value'-focussed use-case, with layer 2, rather than intrinsic, scalability. So yes, Bitcoin itself is something like digital gold, but faster settlement can still happen as things like Lightning develop.

There are very few true crypto***currencies***. There are various reasons for this, but, to oversimplify, it boils down to a lack of consumer demand for that use-case (a currency is only useful if it achieves a network effect, but so far cryptocurrencies just aren't that attractive to mainstream consumers that are used to the traditional system); and to major regulatory resistance (of all use-cases, currency is the one that would upset the traditional order the most, and therefore the one facing the most systemic resistance). Consequently, most DLT projects are seeking to apply the technology to problems *other than* currency.

Nano--if you didn't know already--is one of the few 'pure' currencies out there, with instant tx and non-existent fees. Unfortunately, despite being a cool, idealistic, optimistic sort of idea, it also underlines the point that the market isn't, at least currently, especially interested in such things.",CryptoCurrency
2020-08-09 05:09:02+00:00,"You're only thinking about a single, tiny use case of money, paying for goods and services. That's less that 1% of the value transacted with money. It's literally a nice-to-have at the bottom of the pile.

Think of Bitcoin as value, not money. It's potential value, like potential energy. Built up and ready to be used. 

Just like Amazon vs a traditional book store. They both have the same core proposition, they sell books, but Amazon encompass all of what a book store does, plus adds a whole bunch of functionality which isn't possible in the physical version. 

That's just like Bitcoin, it's money, but it's also a bunch of other things which money is not. It's censorship resistant (people can't stop it), it's open and disputed (everyone helps make it more powerful) and it's permissionless (you don't need to ask). It has the core principals of money, but it takes it to the next level (actually about 10 levels). It's pure value. 

Plus it's leaderless and very simple, with solid fundamentals and not many moving parts. While most other currencies have a CEO and strive for innovation and changes, Bitcoin does the opposite, it has no leader and it strives to be as solid and predictable as possible. 

I could go on, but you get the idea. 

It's not about innovation, but about creating solid fundamentals. That's why it has value, and that's what people miss when thinking about it, they assume innovation is success.

Not everyone is that lucky though. And who knows if you or me are always going to be that lucky?

Of course Proof of Work went horribly wrong and became centralised, and those pools and the miners have no financial interest in faster and larger blocks.

For your drink at the bar, if the bar owner is prepared to risk it, he could do zero confirmations, but on bitcoin capacity limited block size that is very risky.  1 confirmation in 10 minutes is possible, until it isnt included in the next block.  So yeah, unfortunately bitcoin is a fail.

That being said, while Nano sounds great if your main goal is to replace cash, the reality at the moment is that everyone is speculating on currencies, so being a viable cash replacement is surprisingly low on people's list of concerns.

One thing I'd also add is Nano lacks privacy and smart contracts, which I think are both likely to be far more important to future adoption than pure speed, smart contracts in particular allow scalability and speed through centralized third parties, while still retaining the base security of Layer 1 crypto.

Which cryptocurrency will be used is still speculative, but rest assured it will be one that can handle a LOT of transactions as it will be used as the exchange rails for a precious metals backed dollar.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGMcl6ZGQHg

Trump has consistently sought to appoint Gold Standard advocates to the Fed. Stephen Moore, Herman Cain and Judy Shelton. Shelton is set to be confirmed by the senate shortly. But this is just one indicator of many. Trump has long been an outspoken critic of the federal reserve and their monetary policy and has dropped many hints about gold, eliminating federal income tax and using tariffs to fund government [like it did before 1913](https://imgur.com/W3Q0w3w) when the Fed was estabished. He also has great reverence for Andrew Jackson, the President who annulled the charter for the second Central Bank of the US, one of his greatest accomplishments. His portrait [hangs in the oval office](https://imgur.com/ymw6GB2).

So yeah if Trump get's a 2nd term, a return to a gold standard is basically inevitable as the dollar is in a controlled collapse. And now it's beginning to look like him getting a 2nd term is also inevitable, Biden is not even a real candidate at this point. Prepare accordingly.

This might not be what you want to hear, but is already in the works. Precious metals manipulation is also beginning to loosen as I am typing this just look at both the gold and silver chart of the past few weeks.

If you are bullish, than it makes sense (to me) to have exposure to other cryptos that may increase in value at a greater rate. As an example, if BTC goes from 12K to 24K, many of the altcoins could go up 4X+ just because they have smaller market caps, Maybe you want to do 50% BTC and spread the other 50% between other coins. Some other medium/large caps that I think are worth researching are Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH) and LItecoin (LTC). For smaller coins, you really have to focus on hype and remember to cash in before the pump dumps. Unfortunately, logic doesn’t alway reign in cryptocurrency investing. Many times it’s a matter of investing in the right project at the right time AKA-Luck. Some small projects that I’m looking at are BZRX, UNC, RSR, AMPL, and SRK.

Medium term:

* Monero is focused on privacy and there is always going to be an active market for 'private' transaction


Less stable but future potential - Higher risk/higher reward/longer term wait

* IOTA can scale, is quantum computer resistant and has a lot of development and partnership

* Nano is crazy fast transaction already running (IOTA needs more people using it before speed increases). Nano also already solved the scaling issues with it's lattice

* ChainLink has some really interesting stuff with their oracle that other tokens also use 

* VeChain is a b2b product with decent partnerships


My person opinion (not a professional in anyway)

* Etherium is the best balance of safety and reward.

* Bitcoin is safer but less reward

* Monero is relatively safe and will just gradually tick up and up

I've seen some projects incorporating some of those aspects in their initiatives trying to increasing cryptocurrency adoption in the country, but once their founding is gone most locals go back to do what ever they were doing before for processing payments or sending remittances. That makes sense if all they do is trying the path of least resistance.

So, with that in mind I'd like your opinion about Nimiq, which mainly focuses on east of use. I can give you a quick rundown, it allows to connect to the blockchain directly from your browser, without the need for a third party wallet or browser extension, it has addresses compatible with the international banking system and a system of avatars for the accounts, which makes it almost imposible to send a transaction to the wrong address.

2020-08-10 16:14:59+00:00,"You obviously have missed your opportunity to board the crypto train for good gains. Now it's a huge gamble wether we enter a bullrun or not. Personally, I think we will see a recession the coming months and a run again at the end of the year. But then, I don't know. Corona still going rampage, money is being printed out at a crazy rate and people are seeking places to store their value. Crypto once again is seen as a good investment with high risk/reward ratio. Just look at bitcoin, it's done 4x now since March. And what happened in March happened basically each year since the bear market of 2018. 

Now we are at a precept tbh. Either BTC runs towards 18k and we enter a full bullrun (and alts will go CRAZY, I can see eth going towards 1k, Monero towards 3-500) OR BTC starts shitting it's pants, going back to sub 10k and lingers there. 

So it's a risk. Either you buy in and with some luck you join the beginning of the bullrun OR you buy in and lose 30% of your investment because of a (temporarily) retraction. 

That being said, neither BTC nor ETH nor any major altcoins, or those altcoins that will find a place in the world, has maximized their full price potential. So if you are in the long run, today still is a good day to enter the market. Just know, you could lose 30% the coming months and it might take a while to break even. Know that BTC is reaching its ceiling as it has reached this height basically each year since the bubble popped in 2017. So this means nothing. As long as BTC hadn't moved beyond 14-16k, it's best to be sceptical and realize it can retract to 9k and lower. And alts, they will dump double or triple or even more as hard.",CryptoCurrency

2020-08-10 16:39:47+00:00,"He is correct that it is very possible and the BTC core devs have found bugs that could be exploited and will probably find more in the future.   Apparently half of full nodes (not hashing nodes) run outdated vulnerable code.  A 51% attack which is still possible could still take advantage of this exploit.  
 
Bitcoin software has the exploits of any typical networking database software that can be exploited.  Of course this is very tough and unlikely to happen but it is technically possible.  A rogue pool could accompany a very well scripted attack DDOS-ing major hashing pools and creating 5,000 - 50,000 virtual full nodes.  Again it is very costly and probably not likely but it is possible.  Humans don't typically make perfect things and BTC is definitely not perfect.

It does make you wonder though... When a country puts billions in, what begins to happen. And then multiple countries to follow? Granted, many of us will be selling on the way up, and we'll be seeing ebbs and flows since there's always tons of trading, speculating, and attempts to push the market by whales and exchanges.

After we re-hit $20k I think that's a time when a lot of long term hodlers get their cash back out so probably some significant resistance there. But from $20k to $40k seems easy. If you only own 0.25btc, and you bought at $10 and see it hit $40k, do you really sell for your $8k payday? I don't think so. $8k probably doesn't feel life changing to anybody who can invest $2500 into crypto. So maybe they'd sell off 0.06 BTC to recoup their initial investment, even 0.12 to double their money, but the rest they probably sit on.

That supply-side squeeze, I believe propels us to $100k pretty quickly from the $30k-50k range. With FOMO, more companies and countries getting in... We may not be seeing it used on Lightning at POS for years because people want to hold it as store of value, but damn. $1M (in today's dollars,,, I predict worldwide inflation in the coming decade, so $1M then won't be what $1M is today) per btc does not seem ridiculous at all when you consider countries buying in.",CryptoCurrency

————————-

It’s been mentioned but ADA should be a strong candidate since Shelley launched. Goguen due Q3/Q4 2020.

VET have some big supply chain deal announcements that are worth some reading about and consideration for holding. VTHO will stake which has been a steady grower.

SXP partnered with Binance to offer a visa option, been going up lately because of it.

BAND has been crazy this week and is now listed on Coinbase Pro, perhaps another jump coming? Or maybe a drop, who knows? Look at LINK as well but with caution.

Harmony(ONE) is a new project built on the ETC blockchain. New is exciting and it’s had good activity lately. Showing good potential.

Golem Project(GNT) are merging to an ERC20 token soon which should help the value as well as streamline the project more. They have a big vision and the concept of their work is pretty cool.

NEO, the “Chinese Ethereum” as some call it. It’s “low” based on historical averages but also NEO3 is due soon. Been a slow going project but I think it’s about to get some steam going. Stakes for GAS which is also a decent option.

Ontology(ONT/ONG) are the same parent group as NEO, Onchain, and they’ve been busy with this one. ONT 2.0 is live with new staking protocols and also higher rewards for staking ONT for ONG. They’re also doing some Google cloud work and also got a partnership for blockchain ID.

Komodo(KMD) have developed the Antara framework making the concept of building a crypto simple and also have launched AtomicDEX, a pretty slick decentralized exchange app.

Icon (ICX) because they’ve announced a partnership for a blockchain ID service in South Korea. It recently popped up in my watch list and got my attention.

Stellar(XLM) have a Samsung deal that will benefit long term. Also a few other merchant level deals.

Ripple(XRP) I’m a known skeptic of this one but Bank of America are *rumoured* to be preparing to partner with Ripple to use their tech. I don’t know how much that will impact XRP but it is good business for Ripple.

REN. I don’t know much about. Recently became available to me and I’ve started some reading but haven’t gotten deep into it yet. Been green since I’ve been tracking it though. Very green.

if you look at the top 15 on coinmarketcap right now - 10 of those coins are useless. they will never build or provide anything meaningful. they exist solely to enrich the creators and early holders through lies and promises that cannot possibly be kept because the tech cannot support the claim. almost everything trades away centralization for the promise of speed or security and then pretends that theyre actually the most decentralized of them all...

for example - i hate to break it to anyone but Chainlink is just not a decentralized oracle at all. its not much better than me telling you what the price of something is. the devs surely know this too. and there are like 5 worse offenders than LINK in the top 15! you think LINK and BTC are on the same team? they're not.

so look - i'm rooting for crypto and i've placed my bets accordingly in a few projects. but it hasnt proven anything yet. with so many scams and horrible projects out there, i would never fault anyone for only sticking with bitcoin.

ETH - Excellent utility even if transaction fees are currently high ETH 2.0 coming soon (I know, I know)

XRP - Divides many people all throughout the Cryptosphere, dont hold too much but it wont do you any harm to hold some, especially if you can afford to lose it, adoption is what will win the day for Crypto and we're in a battle with Fiat, XRP helps the banks move over to our side

ADA - After years of false promises they are finally getting their act together, exciting rest of the year ahead for ADA

VET - As mentioned with XRP adoption is what will win the day, and VET is well and truly being adopted the world over, very good tokenomics, excellent team behind it, and the VET sub is very amiable

XTZ - I treat my bag of XTZ like a high interest bank account, whether others think it has a future is for them to decide but I can see it reaching £20 within the next 18 months (just my opinion of course)

LINK - Divides many many many people, even more so than XRP, and like XRP it'd be good to have a bag that you can afford to lose, all of the negativity around is justified, however the fucking thing just keeps pumping

If you’ve made the transition away from BTC then the real question is to what extent? Are you an alt maximalist? 50/50? You decide. 

In January of this year I structured a portfolio consisting of ~15% BTC and 2.5-3.5% in each of about 30 of the top 50 alts by market cap at the time. I based my choices essentially on whether or not I could attain them easily and if I thought their name was cool. So far I have not been disappointed, except that I should have waited until March to do all the buying. Oh well.  my LINK, CRO, ADA, and VeChain are carrying my portfolio big time. How was I to know those would net me 4x ROI by now with everything else struggling to net me 2x? 

Anyway, this isn’t a rational market. No one knows what’s gonna hit. The real question is are alts going to outperform BTC or not.

2020-08-14 11:17:18+00:00,"Doge and BTC are proof of work chains meaning the security of the protocol relies on the hashing power of the network. 

BTC and ETH (also POW for now) have congestion and high fees because of high usage.

Other POW chains  like Bitcoin cash and ethereum classic have faced 51% attacks because it is cheap enough to rent hashing power and gain value by reorganizing the chain. 

Barring Doge solving the scaling trilemma (security, decentralization, and scaling at the same time), Doge would likely have the same problems as BTC and ETH.

To me the argument comes down to adoption and longevity. Decentralized networks rely heavily on network effects and future development relies on a strong community. Bitcoin already has higher adoption and I think it's unlikely that the general population will ever take Doge seriously. Therefore it's highly unlikely that Doge will ever overtake the security of Bitcoin and also unlikely that the Doge community will solve scaling before the Bitcoin community does just due to the number of devs.

Edit: Just to be clear, I don't care that much about supply mechanics. As long as it's hardcoded it psycologically doesn't matter too much IMO. Assuming that scaling gets solved (or the fees at least drop relative to price over time) it won't matter all that much that early adopters get rich. Using it as a transactional basis will work just as well whether 1 BTC is 10k or 1mm and more adoption will drive a higher price.

> Fundamental difference between Bitcoin and Dogecoin

The fundamental difference is the 1 minute block interval. If Doge ever becomes popular, the short block interval creates more tied mining races, which means more frequent orphaned chain tips. Is 1 minute long enough for the entire node network to reorg an orphaned chain tip, or maybe 3-4 in a row?

There needs to be fees associated with validation or it will eventually fail as it will get to be too big to easily store.

such things do have some useful applications though. just as a stupid example you could use the bottom 4 or 8 bits worth of value to send information like say text messages or emails rather securely basically for free. so you could build applications on top of it that collect fees for moving data which would incentivize validation and storage. and that stuff could be pruned pretty easily.",CryptoCurrency

Because of the characteristic you've described it's a perfect introduction to crypto for anybody new to the space.  Now onto your question why not Nano?

&#x200B;

If I built an amusement park with a really popular ride, that could only sit 10 people at a time, but held an auction every 10 minutes to decide who gets to ride, you would rightly say that it's a shitty system totally unsuited to solve the worlds' amusement needs.

Now what if another intrepid entrepreneur came along with a ride that could seek 1,000 people at a time-- for FREE!! Well obviously that would *never* work, people would abuse the system so he might say, ""you have to perform ""X"" number of push-ups before you can ride.  Now this system would work beautifully, when 10 people want to ride, or 100 people, or even 900.  But what happen when 1,001 people want to ride?  1,500? 5,000?  Well, essentially it becomes a balancing act of moving the number of push-ups to make the system as usable as possible to the most number of people as possible.  But who gets to move that number?  How is it decided?  What if I can only do a few push-ups, but have waited years to ride? Should bench-pressing an absolute weight rather than push-ups, which are based on one's relative body geometry be fairer?  Perhaps we can switch to something more cardio-based?

This is one of the essential challenges of DLT networks.  It's not specific to Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or Nano.  It's fundamental.  How do we allocate the scarce resource of bandwidth? Bitcoin says, ""an auction!"".  It's a reasonable decision.  Ethereum is transitioning into, ""Well obviously we must first make the resource less scarce (increase the bandwidth), but we will also allow auctions on multiple shards"".

Nano is currently exploring questions such as:

* ""what algorithms favor the type of hardware we want, to encourage the type of usage we want?"". (i.e. FPGA/ASIC resistance)
* ""how do we dynamically alter the ""perfunctory"" work done to de-prioritize network usage we don't particularly want?"" (i.e. spam)

in pursuit of ""fair"" resource allocation.  At the end of the day, questions like these are a life long question!   It speaks to people's appeal to capitalism, socialism, Marxism and everything in between.  After you understand that fundamentally the difference between 7 TPS and  (a ***free!***) 500 TPS fundamentally present the same problems, the actual problems becomes much clearer.

Bitcoin is proudly ""hands off"" in these types of matters.  The simplicity of the auction effectively recuses them of having to make these (ultimately moralistic) judgements.

The decisions aren't inherently good or bad-- they're engineering trade-offs and in some cases social decisions.  Ethereum transaction fees (for instance) are an absolute steal for lots of people using them to conduct profitable economic activity. Lots of other coins could pay it's users and still be a net loss after accounting for external financial friction. 

The topic of bandwidth allocation is one corner of one example of the Nano story (others are ledger retention, staking incentives, performance v. decentralization metrics, governance ).  Each one of these stories could fill it's own pamphlet.  Each coin is made up of dozens of these little ""pamphlets"".

To put an even finer point on your immediate question (which I've posted on this sub many times before, apologies for sounding like a broken record), Nano's unique selling proposition is it's low latency.  But I don't think many are convinced that this is a durable market advantage.  We are trading *digital* assets, and I think everybody here is operating under the assumption that all digital assets will be able to be functionally exchanged near instantly at some point in the relatively near future (i.e. by the time it matters).  I think most people are simply holding what they love and are satisfied with the progress being made concerning towards speed, costs, and security.

I hope all this typing offered you something useful.  I don't claim to be able to read other peoples' minds, but this is how I consider things and think I'm a pretty reasonable guy.

Obviously none of this is in any way a slight against Nano, Bitcoin, or any other project.  It's one more frame you can choose to use or not use to think about how others might be considering various assets from a macro perspective.",CryptoCurrency

VeChain (VET) is a primarily industrial smart contract platform. It was built for its use and they've put some effort into easy onboarding. They sort of have a staking process, where if you have VET in your wallet you accumulate VeThor which is needed to write data to the blockchain and make transactions so there will be a growing market for that if companies keep opting to use VeChain... and quite a few have.

I think that the industry has evolved towards a direction where mainly using a coin for payments is a too simple use-case. I think that the high volatility of crypto is still such a big problem that it incentivizes people to hold the coin instead of spending it, which naturally reduces the adoption of a crypto used mainly for payments.

Of course, dapps aren't fully adopted yet either, but I think that this will occur before a full adoption of a decentralized payment system, such as Nano, occurs.",CryptoCurrency

2020-08-15 18:14:53+00:00,"I'll only talk about my perspective. No idea what others are thinking.

Nano promises fast free transactions in high volume. If something is too good to be true, it always is. I try to keep an open mind though and when I saw 100-th post about ""fast and free transactions"" I decided to read the white paper to see for myself. I only read the original version and I know there have been some changes, but the original should be indicative anyway. Here are some issues I found:

1. It starts by taking a dump on bitcoin and other projects. It is usually a bad sign, if you need that kind of cheap bait in your whitepaper. Etherium, for example, never did that. It is representative of every nano post I've seen as well btw.
2. Confirmation times never discussed. If Alice's node has received a block from another,  when can it be considered safe to see it as confirmed? 10 seconds? 1 hour? What is the point of advertising instant transactions, if one has to wait for the network to stabilize with forked blocks? Will it ever stabilize? POW has statistical guarantees due to resource consumption and miner's incentive, what does nano have?
3. If different nodes have received different votes from representatives and consider their versions confirmed, when will they reconcile their differences? Will they ever reconcile? If Alice double-spends to Bob and Carol and somehow Bob's M representatives vote for his version, and Carol's ones vote for hers, how do they eventually gravitate to the same  version, if no more votes are called according to white paper?
4. If nano becomes currency Bob can burrow nano from a bank for 10 seconds and increase his voting power, then give nano back and essentially rig the system for a (very small) fee.
5. If Bob keeps broadcasting double-spent blocks forever, will nodes forever keep calling for a vote? Paper doesn't say a word. Bob essentially can keep everyone voting forever with his 1 double-spent block for free?
6. What incentive do representatives have to vote at all? It consumes computational   
 resources and network traffic. A generic Alice can vote on her blocks only, especially if there are millions of forks per hour, making it easier to sybil your particular transaction.
7. If Carol can create gazillion accounts with dust amounts, will every node has to store those in ledger forever? Transactions are free, so nothing stops Carol. Whitepaper reference about POW protection is not working, because making a dedicated chip is a trivial business and nano doesn't have difficulty to compensate. Also any threshold protection from dust can be avoided by spending threshold+1. Changing threshold or difficulty also requires a hard fork.

Those are just some points that came to mind. Again, my understanding is very limited, so feel free to rebuff any/all of them. I think technical discussion is exactly what will improve nano's credibility and popularity, and not ""free instant transactions boys!"" kind of posts.",CryptoCurrency

2020-08-16 00:31:27+00:00,"""Why is this coin performing so shittily in this strong bull market?""

Many reasons, but a major one is because of how dramatic its rise was in the last bull market. It's still up way higher than BTC since early 2017- that alone contributes hugely to the consolidation period. I'm not sure anything rose as fast as NANO did in Dec/early Jan of 17-18. Lots of profit taking was bound to to happen after that. That said, it seems it's finally broken its long downtrend. We'll see if it can keep consolidating here & then show a reversal. It seems about time: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/NANOUSD/NA0lDaxk-The-Great-NANO-Breakout/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/NANOUSD/NA0lDaxk-The-Great-NANO-Breakout/)

Another issue is that while the tech is great, but it's just  different enough to not be as interoperable with standard blockchains; and since it's a pure currency, there are no smart contract promises down the line. But if you know about building software, you might see this as a good thing; I think NANO's pure currency focus will prove to be great for its future integration in agent centric protocols, such as holochain apps",CryptoCurrency

2020-08-16 03:37:11+00:00," The answer is very simple. The great economist Jevons in his benchmark book from 1875 ""Money and the Mechanisms of Exchange"" discussed the 4 phases needed for the development of true sound money. Jevons used the history of gold and silver as examples.

Phase 1 - Decorative, a collectable (starts as people begin to adore something like the shine of pure Gold or the whitish luster of Silver when its polished or a rare painting or rare sculpter. Note BTC and maybe even perhaps LTC are now in this phase in my opinion).

Phase 2 - A store of value. 

Phase 3 - A transactional currency. 

Phase 4 - A unit of account. 

You CAN NOT jump straight to Phase 3 without passing thru Phase 1 and 2. But Nano (and Bcash, BSV, Dash, etc... ) are all trying exactly this, to go to straight to Phase 3. Paper money goes straight to Phase 3 as well, by decree or fiat. As such paper money has always historically failed because it has no intrinsic value (i.e., paper money never passed through Phase 1 or 2). Gold and silver have passed through phases 1 through 4 and as such both are true sound money. By the way, the book by Jevons is free online and an interesting read if you haven't already read it, even if it is somewhat dated. That guy had amazing insight.",CryptoCurrency

Some coins will go up 100x and more, but what are the chances that you will be able to pick the winners *before* they go up a lot (and also not sell most of your position after the initial 10x so you can actually realize the 100x gain)?

So I would put at least 70-80% of your crypto holdings in BTC and ETH, and then maybe make some more speculative plays with the remaining 20-30%.

My favorite long term investment alt coin based on fundamentals is the prediction market Augur (REP or REPv2): Real use case for blockchain, huge addressable market, great team, very solid white paper, working product, not subject to the utility token velocity problem.

**Short term**: the majority of forecasters say the economy should continue to pump until the November election. Historically (since 1980) the market has done extremely well for 80% of the 6-month time spans before elections. So, the odds are solidly in favor of a strong market until November. 

If Biden or Trump wins, either will be good for Bitcoin. I won't go into details because it will make half of the readers upset because I can point out the positive effects on BTC of either being elected. Just think about their policies and track records and in either case, Bitcoin and crypto overall will benefit despite the very different effects on other policies of one vs the other being elected.

**Long term**: we've all seen how banks have been given the green light to be custodians for crypto. They will want to get in on the cash cow that is crypto.

* Edit 1: Samson: ""Vitalik is an excellent marketer. Probably better than Justin Sun."" 

* Edit 2: Vitalik says ""Medalla"" with the SH sound. GOAT. 

* Edit 3: Samson: ""What you have here is a very centralized system that is run by a small cartel of people that can dictate changes. That is not really the definition of freedom. That is the definition of serfdom."" 

* Edit 4: Samson: ""Bitcoiners want sound money. They want something foundational and Ethereum is just not that. It's just shifting all the time. The goal posts are moving. You don't even know the supply."" 

* Edit 5: Mod to Samson: ""We care about freedom. Why don't we just focus on bitcoin and forget about ethereum. What harm is it doing to us?"" Samson: ""Functionally, most of us are focused on building on bitcoin and we just kind of entertain ourselves with what ethereum is doing."" 

* Edit 6: Samson: ""I think [ethereum] is harming a lot people, a lot of people are losing a lot of money.. On Defi and everything. I don't feel like there is enough disclaimer being putting on these projects. I think Vitalik himself has endorsed a lot of these projects. I think he's stopped now recently but a few years ago he was still putting his name on various ICO projects and saying this is really cool...""

* Edit 7: Samson: ""If I were to say what the ideology of ethereum is, it's to try everything and see what sticks...""

* Edit 8: Samson: ""I just think that they are putting different terminologies on things to kind of soften the blow of changing it to a trusted model. When you're syncing an ethereum node, you're trusting the system largely. Only a few people in the world actually have an ethereum full node by definition of a bitcoiner which is infura people or maybe ethereum foundation.""

* Edit 9: Samson: ""This is how ethereum thrives. They make things overly complex so that there is no absolute truth. It's complicated. You have to calculate this and that, and the aunt, the nephew, and the cousin and that's why we can't do it, but look at the other stuff that we're doing.""

* Edit 10: Samson: ""I think ethereum is really good at UI. They abstract a lot of things to their retail target so that they just open a page in a web browser but at the sacrifice of decentralization and censorship resistance.""

* Edit 11: Samson: ""But as the creator of ethereum, when you go and say it shouldn't cost that much, do you think that is kind of an implicit promise to your customers...""

* Edit 12: Samson: ""I think the ethereum model is just promoting serfdom. You're a serf of infura. You have to trust them or trust someone else who has enough money to run a node.""",CryptoCurrency

Its really something for the long term investment and even then its not super profitable. I am currently mining ethereum. Honestly i count on using the second round of stimulus to get a couple more 580's and then since thats not really an investment since its the simulus I should be able to break profit pretty quickly after that. best of luck.

I mean, I get he was just trying to direct the conversation and be fair with time, but both Samson and Vitalik seem like people who could keep a debate fairly cordial without the need for a referee. While Samson was definitely throwing some shade, I feel like that was even kind of a result of the structured discussion (e.g. like talking head panels on cable news - everyone just throws out sound bites) where as an organic discussion may have defused that since they'd actually have an opportunity to respond directly.

Also you can't mine anymore with personal hardware. It's actually kind of funny you thought to mine BTC with your laptop. BTC mining difficulty has been so high (for many years already) that you need specialized hardware to mine it (Asics). Ethereum can be mined with GPUs but you basically need a farm in a place where electricity barely costs anything and even then it isn't worth it unless you started out pre 2017 and already made bank. 

Only thing you can mine somewhat is Monero, and you mostly will lose out versus your electricity in first world countries. In my case, I made about the same amount as it cost but that more then a year so. With a laptop your CPU is gimped to (Monero is CPU intensive). You need a 3900x or 10900k to have 'some' gains of Monero (I would guess less then 0.1 XMR per month).

And from an investing perspective that's also a risk of holding Monero: governments cooperating around the World to criminalize privacy-focused cryptocurrencies would likely cause the price of Monero to collapse.

On the other hand, unlike with Bitcoin, with Monero you don't have to worry about people spying on you or exchanges blacklisting your coins or reducing their value because at some point they were part of some suspicious business that you are not even aware of. Or because some institutions or governments are trying to target you.

Each coin has its pros and cons, but I certainly believe that the most solid projects are Bitcoin and Monero, and almost all the others are the product of severe naiveness or outright scams. So, probably the best is hedge the risk by holding Bitcoin and Monero, which I think most Monero users do, given the price correlation betwen the two.",CryptoCurrency

2020-08-17 23:57:35+00:00,"I believe they’ve done everything by ensuring the security of the network is not compromised.

People always want to push the line a little farther out. That wouldn’t solve anything except kick the can down the road for another two years. Then you’d be right back in the same position again and need to kick the can further, and before you know it you’ve kicked the cans so far the network security has been compromised.

The problem is the presupposition that bitcoin needs to be a digital currency. The problem is how the question is framed in the first place. Bitcoin is the number one crypto and will always be, specifically because of its appeal as a store of value. Not because of its appeal as a digital currency. People already have digital currency. You can literally use your credit card anywhere without any fees and get 5% back doing it. You can PayPal anyone in the country for free, instantly. You can even PayPal anyone in the world for a small fee. There’s really no problem to solve there, despite the argument some put forth. I’m not saying there’s no place in the market for a digital currency, but whatever place there is will soon be monopolized by the federal government and any and all rivals will quickly be banned.

Reason bitcoin will survive is because people aren’t buying it to use as a currency. They’re buying it as digital gold. I’m a huge gold bug and I also buy bitcoin to diversify with. Right now it’s in an expansion phase so there is money to be made but it will inevitably hit a plateau at larger market share where it maintains a healthy inflation-adjusted store of value. And it is for this reason that scalability isn’t a problem that needs to be solved in the first place. The velocity of transactions is exponentially lower when a coin is not being used as a digital currency. Nobody cares if they have to pay a three dollar fee if they’re only moving money once every 10 years in large sums. And it is precisely for this reason the security of the network is paramount and should not be compromised.

Perhaps I’m wrong and perhaps there is also room in the market for a digital currency that the federal government will not interfere with. But if so, make your case. Put your digital currency coin on the market and let the people decide. To a large extent that is exactly what’s been done and we can see that those coins just aren’t catching on. There’s a few that have a reasonably devoted following, but they’re not growing like bitcoin is. Litecoin and Dash are stuck in the $50-100 ghetto, and Bitcoin cash will never get over the $200-500 hump. And I know perfectly well why that is- because they’re trying to solve a problem that doesn’t really exist. There just isn’t a huge demand for a digital currency when everyone has credit cards and digital cash. There is, however huge demand for store of value that protects against inflation eating your hard earned labor away.",CryptoCurrency

Is it near previous highs or resistance? If yes, don't buy unless I have trend continuation confirmation.

Has it historically held top positions in cryptos rankings? If it's consistently been in to 10 or top 25 then probably at least decent.

Drawing some fibb levels between it's all time high and low (candle bodies only for this specific case) is it about to hit a level that has historically been respected? Apply support and resistance logic accordingly.

Look at moving averages and such.

There is more I'd do but that's the idea. Don't just blindly buy because it currently ranks high. I'd want to make sure it isn't going to immediately crash. If I'm buying for long term holding I'm looking at the day, week, and month charts for a good entry signal and not buying mid-rally or other high (imagine being one of the people who bought BTC at 15-20k).

Maybe set limit buys significantly below current price in hopes of catching a flash crash if I'm not in any immediate rush to buy. They aren't reliable but if I can get lucky on buying it cheap then why not? Limit orders are your friend.

However, actual index funds such as the S&P 500 have their portfolio allocations weighted according to the market capitalisation of those stocks. If you invest in the S&P 500, 20% of your investment will be split amongst the top 5 stocks rather than divided equally amongst every stock in the index.

If you want to proceed with this idea, the smartest way is assign portfolio allocations based on market cap of the crypto / market cap of all crypto combined.

The vast majority of your investment would therefore be allocated to the top coins which carry significantly lower risk, with smaller and smaller allocations as you move further down the top 100 to higher risk projects.

2020-08-18 22:03:50+00:00,"I think the coronavirus situation is arguably a more significant factor than politics. Whatever administration is in power tends to get the blame or the credit for economic events, so yes, I do think there will be a short-term impact depending on what happens in November, but the effects of the pandemic are real and cut across political ideologies. Global economies seem destined for a period of recession that's largely outside governmental control. Yes, inflation from stimulus spending will be a big factor, but again, almost any government would have done (and did) something similar on that front. And, re: the US specifically, the country is so polarized and so focussed on tribal belief structures over cross-cutting national interests that, whichever side wins the election, the other side will consider it the end of days and react accordingly anyway--so in terms of direct impacts of the election, I'm not sure it makes as much difference who wins as conventional expectations might predict.

Anyway, I think the question you need to answer is how you think crypto will do in a serious recession. Is it established enough, and are consumers skeptical enough about traditional investments (and the institutional establishment they represent), to try something new--in which case it'll pump? Or is it still seen as something risky that you avoid when you need security--in which case it'll dump as investors take money out of crypto and bury it in actual gold, etc? 

I also think it depends on what kind of crypto you're talking about it. BTC is obviously the best known and the most gold-like. On the other hand, as we're seeing with (say) the DeFi sector, individual use-cases can have pretty independent booms and busts, at least over the short-to-medium term.

If you sell LTC on the LTC/BTC pair, you're shorting the ratio of LTC/BTC(in theory, you expect BTC to go up *and/or* LTC to go down, in a lopsided fashion with respect to each other).

If you sell BTC on the LTC/BTC pair, you're longing the ratio of LTC/BTC(same concept as above but opposite).

Your terminology is a bit confusing just because on either of those trades, the value of both assets could both rise or both fall, but you're trading against the difference in that rise and/or fall.

Your gains/losses really *only* matter in the context of taxes, is the issue you're running up against with everyone here. How you handle that is on you and your tax professional.

2020-08-19 03:42:51+00:00,"Ok, so this is how I understand.

LTC/BTC you are using LTC to BUY BTC
BTC/LTC you are using BTC to BUY LTC

Your base currency should almost always be BTC as that has the most pairs out there.

Long ago you could only go USD/BTC, USD/LTC, USD/ETH which means using USD to buy either BTC, LTC, or ETH. Then from there you could go BTC/(any other random coin on the exchange)

The equivalent FOREX trade (and I am sure there is one but I’m an options guy, not a forex guy). This is a made up example.

Let’s say you have USD and you want GBP. Well there is no direct conversion from USD to GBP. There is a conversion from USD to EUR and there is EUR to GBP.

So you are effectively making 2 trades: USD/EUR EUR/GBP.


You can start with lite coin, you can start with any coin really, just make sure the pair is there to get whatever coin you want. Does that make sense?

EDIT: I think part of the problem based on reading your comments. Crypto is not forex, it’s more of a combo between forex and the stock market.  So you aren’t really betting that LTC will raise in strength AGAINST BTC, you are betting that LTC will raise. That’s it.",CryptoCurrency

Here is a simulation on real data. We use the current top 400 coins (so not really the top from way back), and select only the top 50 coins that are at least 3 years old, to get a good approximation of the top 50 from 3 years ago.

Let's say after 2017-08-19, you bought an equal amount of the top 50 coins, once a coin's market cap exceeded 10 millions USD (because realistically you couldn't do otherwise), and didn't buy or sell after that.

Buy and hold would have made you today a loss of 21%, but the maximum profit was 8 times your investment.

Had you started just three months earlier, your profit today would be 68% of your investment (the maximum was 17 times).

Had you started in January (2017), your profit today would be 5.4 times your investment (the maximum was 78 times).

It's important to note that if you sell from time to time, you profit increases dramatically.

Depending on the selling rules, today you could have 11 times more (the maximum was 59 times).

Had you invested (in January 2017) in the coins that were promoted a lot online, the so called hyped coins, and had you sold from time to time, your profit today would be 33 times your investment (the maximum was 146 times).

Smartest thing you can do is figure out why you're in crypto in the first place, is it because you believe in the tech or you're looking for a quick buck? It's my opinion that if you're looking for a quick buck it's all a gamble anyway, if you're in it for the tech, what tech is that? Do you want a decentralised currency, or do you think decentralised apps are the unique selling point for crypto technology? Then figure out what the best crypto is in the long term for whatever you think crypto will be useful for, read up enough that you understand what you're getting into, and only then get in.

The latter is how I went about it, and I'm happy about my decisions so far, even when markets went down. But to each their own, if you're in it for trading and making a quick buck there's or course an entirely different rationale.

The reason why HEX got spread around so much was because of the extremely aggressive referral system they had that paid referrals for any amounts of HEX that was bought or staked from their referral links.

HEX is created from sending ETH to the creators of HEX, which the creators themselves can do, so since April about a Million ETH has been sent to the HEX creators, the majority of all ETH ever sent, and the price/volume has been pumped, of course the ETH is likely sent by the HEX creators to themselves to create the illusion of demand for HEX. This makes it so that they can continually inflate the supply while keeping the price without having to pay more than a fraction of what they collect from those who fall for it.

You are part owner of the business, hence you get a part of the profits.

With Bitcoin there is no reason this should be true. Literally, why should it increase in value in the long run? It's not an efficient currency, it doesn't create value for anyone in any way. All it does nowadays is act as a ""store of value"", and that simply depends on the greater fool theory. There are many cryptos that do anything Bitcoin can do, and can do it faster, cheaper and with less environmental impact.

1. The US federal reserve printed more money in the past few months than in the last 2 centuries of the US being country. Inflation doesn’t happen overnight, but it’s going to happen on a mass scale.
2. US unemployment is now between 20-30%. This means a number of Americans will not be working, will be applying for EI, and will be defaulting on loans.
3. Talking about defaults, they will be coming at mass in the near future. People are already defaulting on their credit cards, are already unable to pay rent and their mortgages. There is likely to be another mortgage crisis in the near future.
4. In the second quarter of 2020 the US had the largest reversal of economic growth in its history as a country.
5. Many countries are already debasing their currencies from the USD due to fears of inflation.
6. The second wave of covid is still yet to happen, when it does the markets and USD will be hit at mass.
7. If a bank collapse were to happen, the US does not have enough money on reserve to bail them out without completely killing their dollar. This would likely trigger a collapse of the US economy entirely, extending around the world, causing a rapid shift from late stage capitalism to the early end stages of capitalism in which society and economy would have to be reformed  altogether. We are also beyond the point in which a green new deal or war could save the global economy should this happen.

The US is supposed to be hit with a double hurricane in the coming week, which could cause economic devastation and humanitarian crisis. The markets are also being carried by a small handful of stocks, like Apple, amazon and Tesla. Both Apple and Tesla are undergoing stock splits which will trigger profit takers to sell at mass, as well as will force these stocks into a position where they will grow more slowly due to dillution, which may be enough to actually trigger the crash of the markets.

I’d say, keep your eyes on the bond market in the coming weeks and months. When US federal reserve bank bonds sell at mass, this means that it is no longer profitable to redeem money in US currency. This will 100% trigger a crash if it happens, with the USD probably falling well below 2008 levels. The market will crash. There is honestly no way that it cannot. The printing of money has offset it so that covid could be managed (it wasn’t but that’s a different conversation).

2020-08-22 18:28:49+00:00,"Just so you are aware the article you linked is from July 2019 and was heavily debunked.

With ORV (Open Representative Voting) similar to DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) it is the users who decide who to allocate their voting weight to. Some people won't like to admit it, but Nano as well as cryptocurrency as a whole is in its infancy. There are currently 88 principle representatives on the Nano network who have enough voting power to broadcast votes ([source](https://nanocrawler.cc/network)). You are absolutely right in that the large amount of that voting weight is allocated to a few big reps, 3 reps have about 33% of the voting weight according to [MyNanoNinja](https://mynano.ninja/principals), Nanovault, Nanowallet and Binance. This is because two of these are early wallets that created reps and many still have their voting weight allocated to them. The last is Binance. Binance has their own principle representative so they have assigned all the Nano that they are in custody of to their own rep.

**This is an issue**. However, is it one that should become less of a problem over time. These reps had more voting weight last year, then Kraken listed Nano and created their own Principle rep, this reduced the voting weight that the top 3 had and now Kraken has 4% weight. As more exchanges list Nano and set up their own principle representatives the more the voting weight should even out. If Coinbase list Nano, they'll almost certainly set up their own principle rep which will see another drastic reallocation of voting-weight, spreading it out further.
 
But its not just exchanges. If a company really likes the idea of accepting Nano for their product/services because they could save ~3% in card or PayPal fees they would feel incentivized to help secure the network by setting up their own Principle Reps. Then you have the hobbyists who don't mind paying ~$50 a month to help secure the network. There doesn't need to be a financial incentive regardless of what the POW maximalists or stakers say. 

> Gold doesn't rely on people to do the right thing. Bitcoin doesn't rely on people to do the right thing

Wikipedia doesn't pay their contributors. The contributors write, research and fact-check articles *because they want to*.  Modders for videogames release their mods to the community free of charge *because they want to*. People seed torrents *because they want to*. Crypto enthusiasts may want to set up principle representatives with no financial incentive to help secure the network *because they want to*.

Also, it's in the best interest of cryptocurrency exchanges and retail companies who have principle representatives to **secure** the network. It would make no sense to collude with other companies to get 51% voting-weight, manipulate the network for a few hours before people starting changing the reps. It would ruin their reputation and their business would consequently suffer. The financial gains from doing so would be peanuts compared to if they hadn't done so.",CryptoCurrency

If the open representative voting consensus mechanism is so secure, why isn't Ethereum considering it for their switch away from proof-of-work? Why did Cardano spend years developing their own staking system? It hasn't even inspired any knock-offs or forks except for Banano (that I'm aware of), which is now lower on the marketcap rankings (#781 according to gecko) than the dumbass Monero meme fork that I launched (#735).

The only reps that hold a significant amount of nano are the few exchanges that let you speculate on nano's value, therefore this is where the majority of nano's voting weight is held. If nano is more widely used in the future (e.g. used for trading Bitcoin arbitration across many exchanges, or if more people simply buy nano across a wider array of exchanges), then you will see nano's voting weight distribute itself better. This is a problem that is sort itself out as nano matures imo.",CryptoCurrency

2020-08-22 18:43:45+00:00,"A couple of points in rebuttal:

- Nano's Nakamoto Coefficient (the number of entities required to collude to attempt a 51% attack) is the same as Bitcoin's:  https://twitter.com/patrickluberus/status/1292532679716601858

- Nano representatives are different from Bitcoin mining pools because they do NOT have control over the blockchain. They cannot reverse, modify, or double spend transactions, even with >50% vote weight. This is partially because of Nano's block-lattice ledger data structure, where every account has its own blockchain that *only the owner can modify*

- Nano nodes *locally* make their own protocol decisions, and cement blocks (mark as irreversible) after they have achieved confirmation. Even if there was a 51% attack after the fact, your node would not reverse the transaction because that breaks the protocol rules (confirmed transactions can't be reversed). Compare this to Bitcoin, where enough hashrate can always reverse Bitcoin transactions. Hell, there was a [1-conf double spend](https://twitter.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1221681807881424898) in January. That's why exchanges make you wait 6-confs minimum, but even that could be theoretically reversed because Bitcoin uses probabilistic finality

- Nano's consensus mechanism allows users to remotely re-delegate their vote weight to anyone at any time, and gives the *users* of the protocol the control. Compare that to Bitcoin where miner and user desires can be at odds (e.g. maximum profit vs minimum fees), and it requires a lot more effort to relocate a physical Bitcoin mining farm

- To even attempt a 51% attack on Nano, you'd have to buy a huge amount of supply, probably pushing Nano's price to beyond Bitcoin's. And all for what, to destroy the value of the Nano you just purchased? Remember that you can't modify, double spend, or reverse transactions, even with majority vote weight",CryptoCurrency

2020-08-22 18:55:54+00:00,"> I want to believe in instant, fee-less transactions with 0 inflation, but the problems seem to outweigh the benefits.

Great, then for starters we have the same goal!

> This small group of people has no incentive to be honest. This supposedly decentralized network relies on just a few people to act in the best interests of the network with no incentive not to do the opposite.

I don't agree with this statement. But let me start off by saying that I would very much like to see more Nano holders delegate to other representatives to make sure the network becomes more decentralised. As is though, it would already take quite a few parties, who all have different reasons to want Nano to continue to function, to collaborate to get 51% voting power.

Either way, on to why I disagree with your statement. If you own a significant amount of Nano, you have every incentive to want to keep the network up and to keep the network decentralised. Going against that motive would decrease the value of your own holdings, so any holder of Nano is incentivised to be honest.

Entities that profit from Nano, such as for example exchanges, have a motive to be honest since Nano trading means more fees for them. Not to mention - how bad would it look for an exchange if they actively tried to sabotage a crypto?

Merchants using Nano to accept payments have an incentive to keep the network up, obviously, as they save money on fees and their transactions are paid instantly and immutably. These merchants might want to run a node themselves, so that you don't have to rely on anyone else to confirm that a customer's payment has come through. 

An additional advantage Nano has here over for example Bitcoin is that even if somehow an entity were to gain control of 51% of the voting supply of Nano, there is still no way for them to modify, double spend, or reverse transactions. Nano is immutably confirmed right away, as opposed to Bitcoin where transactions could conceivably be reversed.

I actually think the ORV (Open Representative Voting) system that Nano uses is one of the best aspects of it. With Bitcoin or PoW coins in general there is always a trend towards centralisation, as there are economies of scale. Every miner is incentivised to mine the most coins, because it will make them the most profit. With Nano's ORV, there is no external entity (miners) trending towards centralisation, everyone who holds Nano is an entity with a stake in keeping the network decentralised and they have a shared interest in making sure it doesn't become centralised.

Right now this is perhaps still unclear and a controversial opinion, but I think that in the future PoW coins will be seen as less secure because of this, and that Nano's ORV system will gain more traction as its decentralisation increases with adoption, which is the trend you want to see.",CryptoCurrency

You see, it isn't the beginning, highly centralized. Since it's creation, the devs had ALL of the coins. Maximum centralization. 

The goal is that human behavior will force you to sell/spend your NANO eventually, also allowing over time the money to just spread more and more. They can try all they want, but cmon, haven't you ever always wanted a rrari? 

It's also true that they have huge power over the network, but also understand that is money. They have to spend it as they know it would only be best for their *own* money that the network flourishes. I trust these major holders already planned how much to keep in reserve and other accounts.

If you still aren't convinced, good. Let NANO show that it's not being taken care of, forcing Binance to recalculate and understand that the market believes it's too centralized. This means *their* money could be worth $0. They will sell.

* Get some crypto cards so you can spend your crypto in every day life when you are ready to start cashing out.
* Learn how to use Metamask and decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. You can find the best moonshots (like 0xMR and MLN) on Uniswap.
* Determine how much of your portfolio you want to place in large caps and how much of it you want to risk on microcaps. I personally have 20% in microcaps to maximize my gains but it's high risk.
* Be skeptical of everything that people tell you about crypto on Twitter, here, 4chan, Youtube. Do your own research!

Bitcoin's utility is that it provides an asset that prevents the confiscation of wealth, a financial netowrk that circumvents captial controls in a lot of countries where you are not allowed to move money out, a store of value in a lot of developing countries where high inflation created by corrupt and incompetent governments is a problem, a censorship resistant network of payments for what government consider illicit goods and services and is a new asset class that is an overall diversifier asset that in general is uncorrelated to the traditional stock market. Now you might have a 1,000 other cryptos that do it faster, cheaper or better (Monero) but what matters is adoption and network effect.

You are part owner of the business, hence you get a part of the profits.

2020-08-23 13:37:49+00:00,"Hi there. Disclaimer, I'm also only a few months in to the crypto market, but I recently set up a workflow directly related to my ledger and cardano. First and foremost, download cardano app on your ledger if you haven't already.

I set up a Kraken exchange account specifically for access to cardano ADA. Kraken was a little intimidating at first, but you can get the hang of it relatively quickly. I first bought some ADA on Kraken by sending some of my ETH from coinbase to kraken, and then trading ETH for ADA. Once my intermediate kraken account got confirmed, I can now buy directly on Kraken with my fiat monies via SWIFT bank transfer. From what I recall, you cannot directly buy crypto with a credit card on Kraken, so bank transfer or crypto-crypto trading is the route.

Then to get the ADA onto my ledger nano, first downloaded the cardano app on ledger via manager. It won't show up in your desktop/mobile app accounts tab but you access it with an intermediary software. I did this via the adalite.io wallet, which is essentially an interface between your hardware wallet and the crypto exchange. You can go to the adalite website and access a cardano wallet directly using your nano ledger. Make sure cardano app is open on your ledger so the public keys are sent and confirmed to adalite. Once you're connected, you have a simple interface to receive ADA from kraken or wherever else you bought it. Once it is in adalite, it is on your ledger. And once you sign out of adalite, it is ONLY on your ledger, not on an offline adalite account.

You can also stake your ADA using the adalite interface. Even when it's stored on your ledger, it is staked. Also always check the url to the adalite interface!! www.adalite.io

There are of course other exchanges with ADA, and other wallets than adalite.io, so definitely explore those options as well. And to anyone else here with more experience with cardano, please offer comments!

Sorry if that's a little long-winded and confusing. tl;dr my workflow:  kraken exchange --> buy ADA --> access ledger wallet via adalite.io --> send ADA from kraken to adalite.io --> sign out and disconnect --> ta-da! ADA safely on ledger.",CryptoCurrency

It is hard to say what he would think about Bitcoin, but he probably would not have liked it because it doesn’t scale well and doesn’t offer anything that cannot be replicated by better versions, such as those listed above. 

More importantly, Bitcoin cannot be easily understood by the average person. One of his core beliefs is that he will not invest in anything that “cannot be understood by a 5 year old.”

The current Warren Buffets are people like Brad Garlinghouse and Sunny Lu. People who saw Bitcoin and realized how to make the technology behind it actually do something vastly more useful.",CryptoCurrency

In spite of the speculation and the ludicrous price, Bitcoin is useful as a currency most of the time, for online purchases. Occasionally, transaction volume is too high, confirmation is delayed, fees increase. During these periods, Litecoin is a viable alternative, because it does not suffer from high transaction volumes  
When the price bubble bursts, the speculators will crawl back to their previous obsession, pumping and dumping penny stocks. Bitcoin transaction volume will fall to reasonable levels  
Meanwhile, Bitcoin mostly works well as a currency in spite of being stupidly overpriced

2020-08-23 14:53:06+00:00,"I'm not much of a bitcoin maximalist but I would say your statement about bitcoin having no utility is a little exaggerated since it's way easier to move 1 billion $ of BTC than it is to move even 100,000$ in fiat, gold or wire transfer across country borders.

recently I have been considering what tokens have value due to utility, like in the last few weeks I've been moving ETH and USDT to buy certain things and used uniswap and it sucks how high the fees are, I've been paying 6$ to move ETH and 4$ to move USDT, seriously that is not the crypto future I was promised that is the same or even worse than bank transfers!
With that in mind, I think zero-fee and low fee cryptos definitely have a utility in the future of finance, because I'm sick of paying transfer fees!

Zero-fee coins I'm excited about:


Nano - was exciting in 2017 seems to have been fairly quiet these days, but I don't think it's done yet.

Vite - low cap interesting project, first DAG to have smart contracts and also deflationary, which excites me.

Iota - again also like nano very quite since 2017 and had a huge drop, they are focused on building the internet of things, big potential but quite a few competitors have risen since they started, still probably not done yet.

EOS - hasn't had as big a fall as iota and nano, could be a little overpriced, but does have big-name recognition. 

Low fee coins:


XLM - fees are not zero but they are crazy low, 0.000001 XLM so basically free.

XRP - not much of a fan of this one though but it has low transaction costs...

bad thing with low fee coins is that ETH had low fees once and now it doesn't, so I'm more looking at the zero-fee coins above. 


There are so many sectors that are being innovated by blockchain so many investment options, but something that will always work exchanges as long as there is trading they make money whether the market goes up or down.


BNB - I wish they had dividends, but how can one ignore this exchange that seems to be the top dog since forever...

VX- low cap DEX, but shares 100% of fees with Vx holders paid daily in BTC, ETH and USDT, the team holds a modest 10% and it's being distributed fairly to stakers and traders on vitex, no presale.

KNC - kyber networks trades ETH and erc20 tokens in a decentralized way, but currently, if you don't hold a huge stack your rewards from staking their coin will be eaten by ETH fees which is an issue, I have 40004 staking and made zero rewards profit... you can join a pool but that didn't seem to work well. if ETH 2.0 ever comes out this might become more interesting.

KCS -  kucoin shares, gives 50% of trading fees to their token holders, I was a fan of them when they paid out in every crypto on their exchange now sadly they just pay in KCS. I used to love getting dust from every coin on the exchange ... alas, no more. 


the new DEFI sector with CDP (collateralized debt positions) is very interesting to me as well but I am a bit weary how Maker had to inflate their token supply to deal with issues that happened at liquidation time of some CDPs during a crash. Its something to think about since crashes happen often in crypto, these are some interesting coins in that sector:


Kava - stackable token with deflation, deflation created by burning kava when CDP is closed.

Aave - used to be LEND before the rebrand, does a lot of lending collateral dept stuff, doing very well right now 

I hope these points of view were interesting to someone :)",CryptoCurrency

2020-08-24 02:43:15+00:00,"Since you're only working with $1k I'd suggest you stay away from BTC. If you put that in BTC you'd basically need some kind of paradigm shift in world economies to make significant money at this point. Without that miracle you'd just have the small amount of crypto to experiment with, and BTC fees would make it even less when you actually tried to use it. The best way to learn about crypto is to transfer it around.

Cardano is a decent project. You could learn a lot about crypto from playing around with it, learning to stake, etc. Plus the fees will be cheap and they'll be lots of new releases that will make it more exciting to follow (and can be pump opportunities).  So I'd suggest you maybe keep around half in ADA, and use some of the rest to buy at least 1 ETH. ETH is where the vast majority of the action is these days and anyone telling you different is a shiller or maximalist. So you are going to want some exposure to ETH. 

ADA uses UTXO system like bitcoin, so if you learn to use ADA you will know how to work with BTC if you eventually get more money to invest. And the ETH will give you exposure to smart contracts, which is the future of crypto.

Oh yeah, you also said you like LINK, so maybe do 40% ADA, 40% ETH, 20% LINK. You'll need some ETH to pay the LINK transaction fees anyway.",CryptoCurrency
2020-08-24 02:44:01+00:00,"Nano is fundamentally different from Bitcoin.

I'm not going to cite how they both have a Nakamoto Coefficient of 4. I'm not going to cite how today, with present market cap, it would take \~65x the monetary sacrifice to attack the nano network as to attack the bitcoin network (because a 1h bitcoin 51% attack would cost \~800,000 USD whereas purchasing just the threshold of nano - minimum amount necessary to take ""control"" of the network if you managed to take down every other node - costs \~52,000,000 USD)

No, I'm sure you've seen both of these from other people by now because you are an informed and intelligent person.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Instead, I'm going to explain why **even if it were extremely centralized**, it doesn't matter; no one would be able to double spend your coin or create fake transactions.

&#x200B;

Every transaction that involves your coin in any way requires you to have signed one of the two involved blocks with your private key. This means **even if I controlled >>51% of the total online weight, I couldn't broadcast transactions that any other node would recognize as valid to move your coin around**. This is based directly on the security of the public/private key pair of your account. Shared secret cryptography has a long proven history extending nearly the age of the internet. Sure, I could fake my own database, but even with an overwhelming majority of the weight no one else on the network - regardless of their stake amount - would accept my version of events because the blocks would be mathematically invalid.

&#x200B;

Okay. What about erasing your transactions?

Nodes cement blocks as soon as they receive sufficient weight verifying their validity **and** the blocks are mathematically valid. This means that I, as a >>51% weight representative, could not convince any other nodes to delete your transaction. Again, I could delete your transaction in my local version of the ledger, but there is no way for me to convince any other nodes that your transactions have miraculously disappeared.",CryptoCurrency

If you listen to what everyone says you should do, you've already lost. In the end, (almost) everyone has an ulterior objective, for most that objective is to make money for themselves. There are very few on here that are truly unbiased. 

Smartest thing you can do is figure out why you're in crypto in the first place, is it because you believe in the tech or you're looking for a quick buck? It's my opinion that if you're looking for a quick buck it's all a gamble anyway, if you're in it for the tech, what tech is that? Do you want a decentralised currency, or do you think decentralised apps are the unique selling point for crypto technology? Then figure out what the best crypto is in the long term for whatever you think crypto will be useful for, read up enough that you understand what you're getting into, and only then get in. That goes for #1 on the market cap rankings as well as for #100 on the market cap rankings. 

What I wrote above is how I went about it, and I'm happy about my decisions so far, even when markets went down. But to each their own, if you're in it for trading and making a quick buck there's of course an entirely different rationale.

By promoting the financial inclusion for millions of people, Bitcoin will be a game-changer around the world, but even more so in Africa, where hundreds of millions of people have always been excluded from the current monetary and financial system.*

That statement and this [updated rich list](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-rich-list-high) are contradictory. 

With only 21 million bitcoin to be mined there is an obvious problem of limited supply. The fact that a majority of the Bitcoin whales were early investors means that in this dystopian future that OP is rambling about there will be a new 1%. It doesn’t create equality to the people it simply creates a new inequality that is arguably worse. 

*The #StackSats movement started from this. In the world of the future, when the Bitcoin price reaches the million-dollar mark, talking in Satoshi will become the norm. The basic unit of Bitcoin is Satoshi. By owning just 0.01 BTC, you are already considered a millionaire in the Bitcoin world.*

*WHEN* is actually a big fat *IF*. That implies that the world will adopt cryptocurrency without realizing the very obvious flaws in bitcoin as a currency. As a hedge fund, a savings fund or a reserve asset, yes. But not as a currency. 

*Energy consumption to mine Bitcoin is a strength, not a weakness*

*Many people criticize the fact that Bitcoin mining is a resource-intensive activity. Proof-of-Work would be an outdated algorithm that cannot allow Bitcoin to become a real alternative to the current system.
These people are wrong.*

It is a flaw. Our planet is already damaged enough and proof-of-work is dated and proven that it’s not the solution nor the only option. Denial of this is denial of progression and innovation. We need to do what we can to save our planet and [Bitcoin mining uses the power of seven nuclear plants](https://news.bitcoin.com/the-bitcoin-network-now-consumes-7-nuclear-plants-worth-of-power/).

2020-08-25 21:28:34+00:00,"Each transaction is locked with a puzzle that means certain criteria must be met for that puzzle to be solved.  Each address that recieves funds has an associated private key, and in most cases that private key allows the puzzle to be solved.  When sending a transaction the sender unlocks the puzzle from the previous transaction that sent the funds to him.  Assuming he is the only one with the private key, he is the only one that can unlock the puzzle.  This is why wallet security is so important.

As the network at large has no interest in the transactions that didnt have the puzzle correctly solved, attempting to send a transaction without the correct puzzle solution will mean the transaction is ignored by miners.

Its possible to have addresses with more than one private key required, they are so called multi-signature or multi-sig addresses, and they can be used for people who want to share a single address.  For example a business may make an address with 5 private keys, and give one key each to 5 managers, and require 3 of 5 managers to sign any  transaction.",CryptoCurrency

Bitcoin was first, there is no denying that. But that’s where it kind of ends. Too many projects have come out with big plans, creative vision and unique ideas that they are implementing to blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies. PoW itself is being proven to be the “old school” tech now that PoS is being implemented more. I’ll keep it to bullet points. 

- Transaction speeds, or lack thereof, are a reason not to use it. 

- Transaction fees are too high. 

- It consumes far too much power for mining

- Mining is now reserved for large companies and whale investors

- If you didn’t get in early you will never join the Lambo club 

- They lack innovative ideas; resting on its laurels

- [The *rich list*](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-rich-list-high) owns almost half of BTC in circulation

2020-08-26 13:53:04+00:00,"There are two major ideas with trading external assets

1. pre-settlement
2. post-settlement

Pre-settlement includes everything from a direct issuer like Circle -> USDC, wBTC, to decentralized custody like m/n relayers, REN and tBTC, to a IBC style bridge where assets are deposited into a smart contract that implements a light client of the remote chain.  Basically assets are migrated into the trade environment and then traded natively.  Then assets are migrated out after the trades are executed.

Post-settlement is more interesting. You can think of it as two parties agreeing on a trade and then settling only after the matching engine tells them to settle.  At a high level, two parties get matched on Serum, then both are forced to execute a HTLC atomic swap or pay some penalty.  Serum verifies the HTLC is complete and the trades are considered fully settled.  The interesting part is where that penalty is paid.  With smart contract chains it can actually be paid on the native chain like Ethereum, or just on Serum.

You could even construct something like a Uniswap style pool on Ethereum, but except for the XY=K the ratio is decided by execution of the trades on Serum and a light client proof for that execution.

Since Serum is open, permission less, and open source, all of the above is the answer.  Every combination of UX, settlement risk, and cost can trade in the marketplace.",CryptoCurrency

*When the next Bitcoin Bull Run has started, the Bitcoin price will soar. Seeing Bitcoin reaching $50K by the end of 2021 is my most conservative assumption. If I am optimistic, I would even expect a Bitcoin close to $100K.*

*If*. If there is a bitcoin bullrun. Don’t count your chickens before they’re hatched. 


*You have probably heard at least once the expression that it is futile to compare apples to oranges. This expression has certain variations in the rest of the world. In South America, it is often said that you should never compare potatoes and sweet potatoes.
In Europe, this expression applies to apples and pears.
In any case, the deeper meaning of the expression is always the same. In life, there is no point in comparing radically different things.*

2020-08-27 14:54:01+00:00,"1 scaling. Scaling is an issue when you're talking about transfers. Bitcoin as it is today, only allows a certain number of transactions to be written in a block which is mined from time to time. The block size and the time it takes to mine it is pretty much unchangeable for now. This means if you have an increase in usage, the number of transactions to be written could increase at a bigger rate than those actually being written. This poses a big issue that need to be addressed if you want bitcoin as a currency. Also it makes the fees go up. If you're talking about processing power scaling, it's not as big of an issue because the progrem itself adjusts the difficulty of the algorythm according to the processing power of the network. Making the mining of the blocks take more or less the same time independently of the processing power.

This takes us to your second point

Centralization: there's one big company producing specific hardware to mine bitcoin. This hardware is so efficient compared to traditional computers it has rendered them useless. It's called bitmain and it's a Chinese company. Their business model is creating this hardware, use it till they create a newer, better, more efficient model, AND ONLY then, sell it. This means that have a monopoly (or at least makes them the most powerful) bitcoin mining company as only they have the better hardware to do so. This creates a series of thechincal threats to bitcoin, none of which have happened (yet), and still remain on paper, like 51% attack

Other issues with bitcoin would be

PoW: position of work is seen as many as a problem. It means bitcoin must spend (much much) energy to mine blocks. It's stated that the bitcoin network spends as much as a nuclear power plant of energy to work (or so, I read it on this sub reddit a few day ago). This is wasted energy because all its doing is solving mathematical problems. The thing is, no other ""proof of... "" is as tested or as ""certainly"" secure as this. Ethereum supposedly will change to PoStake and then we might see if it's better.
But even if PoS is better there's another problem bitcoin faces, which is directly connected to the centralization problem..

Difficulty in change: to change the bitcoin protocol, the software needs to be changed and most users must start using the new software. If the changes are relevant enough this creates what you might have heard before, a fork. First of all, this means if a new technology appears, and people want to implement it on bitcoin, it must be so overwhelmingly clear its a good addition to the protocol, that most users actually take the time to download the new program and use it. If it's not (and I mean if it's not clear that's a good addition,like increasing the block size, some want it, some don't) , then most wouldn't use it and it doesn't become part of the bitcoin protocol. And even if it's clear, you have some centralization in the form of bitmains hardware (as said before) so they could boycott the application of new good software only because it hinders their profit. BUT this also has some benefits. It means the application of malicious software, even if most people think it's good, is hindered.

There are also many other problems that many other cryptos try (and are able to) solve. The thing is, bitcoin has 60% of the crypto market cap, belongs to no one and has endured the test of time. These three factors surpass any other problems it might have, at least for the time being.

Or, buy gold bullion with your credit card, refine it (1-2%) and then take the resulting cash and buy bitcoin.  

Then, sell options against the bitcoin (+50%) at the money calls.

The centralization of miners is not a HUGE problem unless the possibility of China shutting them down or taking them over happens. I’m not saying that it’s likely, but it’s foolish to say that it’s impossible. Along with the centralization of miners [the rich list proves that we will have a new 1%.](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-rich-list-high) 1000 BTC is held by 2200 wallets and of those wallets a majority of them hold well over 1000 BTC. The early adopters and whales hold a majority of BTC in circulation. [Grayscale bought 33% of all newly minted BTC](https://news.bitcoin.com/grayscale-buys-33-of-all-bitcoin-mined-in-last-three-months/). 

I don’t argue that it’s a good asset to invest in, like digital gold. But that’s where it ends for me. There is no use case for it to be adopted for daily spending, the fees and speeds are ridiculous. Unless it’s used as a credit system with a centralized authority(like VISA, Mastercard or Grayscale because they’ll have most of it at this rate) providing verification of funds for exchanges to happen then using it for spending is highly unlikely to happen. 

Mining is also not very sustainable going forward. The argument against is that it uses a lot of power. The argument for is “it’s all renewable energy” and “it proves value that it’s *hard earned money* unlike fiat” but it’s still not helpful toward going green. If you haven’t heard the earth isn’t exactly getting healthier[(although covid did her some favours allowing some breathing time)](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52485712). Proof of Work requires far too much power to think we can handle another 120 years of Bitcoin mining.

This age of boomers will most likely not be involved in crypto other than conversations because if she can't keep up with her will, she won't know where seed words are stored. I often have to show her how to work the remote control for things like when she gets a PIP and can't figure out how to undo it.

It is just going to be one of those generational things that has to happen before the majority of masses are completely involved in it. From B/W TV to color to internet and cell phones, older people have a learning curve to keep up while youngsters learn it early and stay immersed in it. I swore I would never not keep up with technology but I was very foolish to think so.

While I was very smart, top of class, etc. I find that just as my Mother said, ""Just wait 'till you get older!"" (in reference to doing silly things like misplacing keys or can't turn on a phone) it is now coming to pass. I somehow turned on silent mode on my phone without realizing I did it and wondering why I was getting no messages from people telling me they were sending them. I put my car keys in the refrigerator and was late for work. I used to hear people talk about their ""blackberry device"" which I had no idea what it was. It wasn't until no one used them anymore that I learned what it was. I am falling behind.

While I've managed to figure out how to create wallets and buy/sell, it took some researching and investigating but it was something I was interested in. If you are not interested in it, no amount of effort is going to put you down that path. In 2016, co-workers started telling me about BTC and I laughed at them, called them silly for wanting to invest ""real world money"" into ""fake internet digital money"". They were buying, I was laughing. I finally began to listen to their conversations, I started reading and investigating. It began to become more common to talk about BTC with them so much so that I began buying a little to test the waters. I began reading about ETH as it was touted as being the next BTC so I figured I'd make that my BTC since I had lost out on years of low prices (BTC was $845 at that time) and ETH was just $10 so that began my journey and in that short time it has all changed so much.

To convert your BTC, you'll need to have it on an exchange.  So at some point, you'll be using an exchange.  Regardless of what others (including myself) say with respect to not keeping funds on an exchange, it is inevitable that you'll have them on-exchange for a short time at least.

By using some of the most reputable exchanges, you'll minimize your risks.  Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, and other big names should see the lowest risk of losing funds, and the less time that you have assets on the exchange, the less risk you face.

Having said that, for a lot of newer or less experienced users, there is an appreciable risk in transferring assets from an exchange to a wallet.  A lot of people make mistakes.  So if you're talking about small amounts, I don't see a reason why you shouldn't feel safe leaving some funds on an exchange, especially if it is one of the more reputable ones.",CryptoCurrency

You don't have to do it in small $100 increments. Although if you are paranoid, you could do it in $2k increments if you want, just don't waste time doing $100 at a time for $10k.

The big thing to do is to research the exchange you are going to use before you fund your account. Check forums to make sure they aren't having problems with people withdrawing money. Make sure they have reasonable fees. But watch out if their prices are TOO good. Scam exchanges will offer great prices to sell your bitcoin, and people will use them without researching because it looks like such a great deal.

And just because an exchange was legit 1 year ago doesn't mean they are ok to use today. So even if you used them previously, check up on them again before sending money. Quadriga was a legit exchange for a long time, but then over a few months they slowly stopped paying out withdrawals until they stopped completely and stole everyone's money.",CryptoCurrency

We are constantly adding more funding options but for reference take a look at [fiat withdrawal methods](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000423043-Fiat-currency-withdrawal-options-fees-minimums-and-processing-times-) we currently offer, and an article about [how to get started](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/201396417-Account-setup-How-to-get-started-with-Kraken-).

There’s a reason Coinbase is getting traction. It’s simple to understand and convert fiat, and they’ve done an excellent job dumbing the space down to a mainstream level of understanding. Mobile currency needed a Paypal to normalize the space. The same needs to happen for crypto. Once the foundational understanding is there, folks will start to branch back out into more sophisticated uses/layers with increasing complexity, just like retail investors do in traditional markets.

Ethereum(ETH)- ETH 2.0 phase 0(binary for phase 1)is due soon with it being in the Medalla testnet now(the final testnet). Big plans and big dreams with this project. Obviously as my username suggests I am biased to this one.

Ripple(XRP)- I’m a known “hater” of this one but I’ll still list it for unbiased research purposes. Ripple is the company and XRP is the token for the platform. Ripple have made a lot of partnership announcements with international banks. Cross border banking seems to be a focus for them. 

Stellar(XLM)- some of the XRP team moved over to start XLM after some disagreements at development level. Stellar seems to be more focused on the merchant and consumer side of banking. XLM and XRP can have a harmonious future together. 

Cardano(ADA)- Shelley is live. Shelley is the PoS system that means it is fully decentralized relying on staking nodes to run the network. There are over 1000 already. Goguen is due Q4 2020 which will enable smart contract development. 

NEO/GAS- Gas is the token for the NEO network. A big focus for NEO right now is NEO3 which will open up the DeFi market and allow easier dapp development. A very developer friendly platform(java, c#, python instead of a custom language). NEO is also really committed to cross chain compatibility. They want NEO to talk to other blockchains. 

Ontology(ONT/ONG)- another OnChain project(originally developed on NEO) ONT are focused on blockchain ID and enterprise adoption of it. ONG is the gas token for the network fees. In the ideal future economic world NEO and ONT will work with many other chains to provide services. Neither of them wants to be a “killer” but rather mergers. 

Icon(ICX)- Also working on ID and enterprise level adoption. Recently announced a deal with banks in Korea to provide their service. It’s been a quiet project but is starting to make some noise. 

Cosmos(ATOM)- *the Internet of Blockchains* is their explanation. Interchain network aiming to bring on cross chain compatibility. Also see Polkadot(DOT) for a similar concept. 

That’s a little list to start some thinking. Do not invest in them based on this little detail. I’m not here shilling my coins. I just like to share options of projects I follow and research myself.

2020-08-31 07:07:07+00:00,"I'm going to make some suggestions but you definitely need to do your own research before investing in cryptocurrency.

* Buy Bitcoin
* Devote a portion of your funds, 10-20% of your portfolio to moonshots like $0xMR, $BZRX, $MTA
* Stake $BZRX and $MTA (if these platforms do as well as I think they will you will be able to live off of your monthly staking rewards).
* Sell a portion of your funds when you have 10x and invest it in new moonshots you have researched

How do you change BTC into Ethereum tokens? You need to register on exchanges that have a fiat onramp (this will allow you to cash out when you are ready). Send your BTC to one of those exchanges and trade for ETH. Withdraw your ETH to a metamask account you set up (save your password and seed words somewhere safe and do not share them with anyone). Buy the projects you like on Uniswap (wait for gas to go below 100gwei on Ethgasstation. 

If you want to make it you need to find and invest in projects that haven't mooned yet. There are a lot of scams on Uniswap now so be careful.",CryptoCurrency

2020-08-31 10:31:36+00:00,"(As a beginner that made several mistakes) 

Depending on how much you want to invest, if you plan on starting with hundreds of dollars, just stick to one or two coins.

My mistakes:

I was looking at my portfolio every minute, moving one coin to another that I believed would go up tomorrow and then sell at a small profit or loss when I panicked. Just put 70% of your portfolio in stable coins that grow in value every year and have strong bull runs. Don't touch them, don't check on them, just forget you even bought them for a couple of years. (obviously if you want to buy on monthly basis don't forget them)

So don't touch your main investment no matter what, unless you hear that they are migrating or going bust. 

Don't keep jumping from one coin to another, especially not with a couple of hundred of dollars, the chances of you paying exchange fees matching what you earned are not worth the effort, i have finally decided not to touch my entire portfolio and in the last day it went up several percentages without me running around and checking every second.

Now, about the 25-30%, I suggest you invest in some alt coins and a small amount for something that is fresh or even going to be listed but you believe in their vision (for instance I put around 7% in DOT, I kinda believe it will catch on and gain traction)

So, to sum up what I learned as a noob who wants to hold mostly, and until I get the hang of it:

* Invest most of your portfolio in your choice of the top 10-15 coins, as others said, if you have a thousand dollars, don't buy in 10 different coins, buy 2 or 3. If you plan on putting thousands then invest in 4-6 (the chances are most of them will grow by around the same percentage are high anyways, which means investing in 5 or 10 is essentially the same with the big coins, so save the exchange fees and choose less).
* Don't exchange coins every day, hold, until you get the hang of it and know what you are doing. 
* Don't panic and keep looking at the coins every second, they are like waves, they will go up and down, but eventually in 2, 3, 5 years you will see a good investment done. 
* Invest a smaller portion of your portfolio in newer tokens and coins, they might flop or reach the moon, expect either, and if you can't afford it, just buy more stable coins. 

I am new as well, i can tell you what i invested in but I suggest you do your own research, and ask more experienced people.

35% Ethereum / 25% bitcoin / 20% litecoin / 10% xrp / 7% dot / 3% bat

The list of coins I want to invest in when I have extra cash (not necessarily all but to choose 2 or 3):

ADA / BNB / COMP / EOS / ChainLink / NEO / TRX / XMR

I had invested in a dozen other coins until I realized my mistakes and decided to consolidate everything and just throw my wallet away and check on it every now and then, i mostly check reddit in case of catastrophic news and I need to act, and not the histograms.",CryptoCurrency

2020-09-02 01:11:39+00:00,"I don't think it was Hal guys. But he was a great early contributor

My reasoning lies in the birth of the word 'block chain'. Hal was the first to mention this in his first [response](https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09975.html) to the whitepaper:

>For example, it is mentioned that if a broadcast transaction does not reach all nodes, it is OK, as it will get into the block chain before long

At the time, in both source code & white paper it was referred to as a 'time chain'. In fact, it wasn't until the third version of the code 0.1.3 in Jan 2009 that the word time chain was updated to be 'block chain', & it was known as that ever since.

My thought process is that Hal read the white paper and then dotted his thoughts in his first reply, but got some of the lingo/syntax wrong and accidentally referred to it as a block chain instead of a time chain without realizing. Then later on, Satoshi (or Hal, because Hal was probably contributing code by 0.1.3), changed the code to reflect this name as well as they thought it was a better fitting description.

If Hal really was Satoshi & was talking to himself, then that's some next level trolling there to purposely call the time chain a completely new unheard of name, release 2 versions of the code STILL calling it time chain, & then on the third version rename it to his new name 'block chain'

Also, I don't know what Hal was like as a person, but [this](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2188.msg29259#msg29259) would have also been some next level trolling, big upping both himself as well as his pseudonym:

> That means a lot coming from you, Hal.  Thanks.

Finally, I always found the use of a comma right before the last word of a sentence very unusual, & I think I saw satoshi do this 2 or 3 times in his writings.

I found 1 other example of this in another [comment](https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/10/unenumerated.html) by Nick Szabo. Co-incidence?

Once the Lightning Network gets adopted more, and merchants starts using it for instant transactions, with lower fees for everyone, you'll basically be able to use XSN to pay for everything, since it's cross chain compatible. This also means that ANY Lightning Network ready project can be used as payment whereever BTC LN payments is available.   
This is a win/win for both parties, so I'm eagerly awaiting this to be adopted on a much larger scale.   


Most people critisizing the Lightning Network, doesn't understand that it can be used in a decentralized manner without all the ""exploits"" and ""loopholes"" if you do what Stakenet has done.   
Masternodes will become ""watch towers"", and will rule out any bad actors from the network. Their DEX has been worked on for more than 2 years, and NOBODY has ever lost any coins from using it, just saying.   
It soft launched last month, so anyone can go and try it.   


Just saying, I know there will be plenty of you down voting me, but the truth of the matter is, it's BS that you can't use ALL crypto coins/tokens as you want, ""just"" because merchants doesnt accept it.",CryptoCurrency

“As security researcher Dan Kaminsky explains, Bitcoin looks like a security nightmare on paper. A C++ code base with a custom binary protocol powers nodes connected to the Internet while holding e-cash, sounds like a recipe for disaster. C++ programs are often riddled with memory corruption bugs. When they are connecting to the Internet, this creates vulnerabilities exploitable by remote attackers. E-cash gives an immediate payoff to any attacker clever enough to discover and exploit such a vulnerability. Fortunately, Bitcoin’s implementation has proven very resilient to attacks thus far, with some exceptions. In August 2010, a bug where the sum of two outputs overflowed to a negative number allowed attackers to create two outputs of 92233720368.54 coins from an input of 0.50 coins. More recently, massive vulnerabilities such as the heartbleed bug have been discovered in the OpenSSL libraries. These vulnerabilities have one thing in common, they happened because languages like C and C++ do not perform any checks on the operations they perform. For the sake of efficiency, they may access random parts of the memory, add integers larger than natively supported, etc. While these vulnerabilities have spared Bitcoin, they do no not bode well for the security of the system.”",CryptoCurrency

[Paul Le Roux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Le_Roux) turned a career as an software engineering prodigy into a deadly weapon, writing encryption that Edward Snowden's leaked documents revealed the NSA were unable to crack and using it to order assassinations and drug deals.

He established a network of doctors and pharmacists to peddle painkillers throughout the US, becoming one of the biggest individual contributors to the opioid epidemic. He then built a network of mercenaries through LinkedIn to smuggle guns, gold, diamond, illegally logged timber, and North Korean meth before trying to establish himself as a warlord in Somalia.

It's [possible](https://www.wired.com/story/was-bitcoin-created-by-this-international-drug-dealer-maybe/) that Le Roux also invented Bitcoin, having been arrested right before Satoshi Nakomoto went dark online, and often using the alias ""Salotshi"" on his fake passports.

1. Everything went fine.  Initially (last year) they didn't provide the TXN-id, which would piss me off, but now it is derivable through email or TXN history.
2. ***H U G E***&nbsp; security problems - The apps ***ONLY*** security beyond SMS 2FA is the 4 digit pin.  It really is a joke as far as security goes.  I really wish they would add something like U2F (security key) or at least Google Auth.  My advice is to sign up with your email instead of your phone number.  This will at least reduce SIM swaps.  With email 2FA and PIN (\*giggle\*), your about as secure as they will let you be right now (which is to say... not at all).
3. No one is going to hack Square.  99.99% of all ""exchange hacks"" are individual users getting sim-swapped and using poor passwords or 2FA.  But, no, I know of no CashApp insurance like Coinbase.
4. Deposit = Free (your bank may charge), Slow withdraws are free, instant withdraws are about 2%.  Bitcoin buy/sell operations have a 2% fee.
5. If you didn't set it up with the email like I suggest above, you are ""up the creek"".  I suppose there is some manner of recovery, but it might take months to get access again.
6. Highly recommend it for people that don't know better.  For people that know how FedWire works, and know how FOREX works, and know how U2F works, I recommend CoinbasePro.  But very few people know all those things.",CryptoCurrency

Also considering fiat is about to be digitized which will allow them to have greater control over inflationary forces.,CryptoCurrency

2020-09-03 14:53:50+00:00,"Back in 1933 the USA was still on a gold standard and needed to stimulate the economy with injecting liquidity.  They could not print gold.   Before 1933 all 1 ounce gold coins were interchangeable with $20 bill at any bank.  Thus, they had to confiscate all coins before devaluing the currency.   Today we are completely fiat and don't have that problem.

But when the Fiat is totally failing, everyone will run for the exits.  If governments can seal the exits, everyone will burn inside the movie theater and nobody can prosper or survive.  First step governments would do is limit fiat transactions into any safe haven exit.  Banks would prevent transfers to crypto.   This is already happened in Argentina and Lebanon.  But for it to be totally successful would probably have to keep everyone inside the country with their wealth.  I  remember being at the Singapore airport a few  years ago,  witnessing a huge line in front of every  Bitcoin ATM just after aircraft from China landed.

Even though they have a trade fee of 0.5%, it's still worth it to buy from them, but only if you're willing to transfer to cold storage. This is not true however for purchases above ~1000$ of BTC (according to 10k/BTC price), since in this case, services like Kraken that only charge a fixed 0.0005 BTC per withdrawal (5$ worth at 10k/BTC), turn out to be more worth it.

Now kraken would be my next suggestion. I love this platform, they have one of the best supports I've ever witnessed (24h live chat, willing to help you with any issue, they were even kind enough to cover my very newbie questions on a live discussion), in addition to security, 2FA, including their app with API key use. They charge a 0.14% trade fee. If you're not willing to use cold storage as mentioned above, this should probably be your choice, along with Binance (0.1% fee).

The positive astrological influences on September 2nd were coupled with a few negative influences that made me less confident on bullish movement for this particular date compared with the other two dates. In light of the recent downturn in the price of bitcoin which occurred on September 2nd, I have revised my views on September 14th and September 17th.

Although I think there is a chance of greater volatility during this period of time, these influences seem too risky for me to maintain any statement on whether they could indicate positive or negative changes on the price of bitcoin.
